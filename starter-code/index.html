              <h3>Academy Experience</h3>

              <h4>Business Skills</h4>
              <p>Firstly and most importantly foremost our organisational skills and punctuality has been drilled into us as a critical first step in the commercial environment we work in with our clients. Also daily, we work on and improve our presentation skills as that is a key skill for any consutant to deliver and deploy a product effectively in collaboration with a client.</p>
              

              <h4>Web Technology</h4>
              <p>I have used an array of web technology, especially in various web development projects, ranging from freelance to in the workplace, using content management systems such as Wordpress and languages such as PHP and HTML.</p>
              <p>Since initiating my training at Sparta the learning curve has been intense and I have now reached an advanced level of HTML5 and CSS3 to go along with my current knowledge of web development frameworks such as Python's Django.</p>

              <h4>Software Testing</h4>
              <p>I have experience applying functional testing and unittest in Python projects ranging from building mathematical algorithms for financial firms to developing websites i.e. Django, HTML etc.</p>
              <p>We have so far tested our HTML/CSS/Bootstrap websites and projects consistently throughout our early stages of training.</p>

              <h4>Automation</h4>
              <p>Although we have not as of yet touched on Automation at the academy, I have previously created automated scripts/algorithms in Python to backtest data and data wrangling with Pandas and numpy.</p>
              

              <h4>Agile</h4>
              <p>In the academy we work daily in an agile environment from our first interaction as a team in the morning standup meetings, which is continued throughout the day in the way we train and constantly give and receive back to our trainer as you would a client.</p>

              <h4>Ruby and databases</h4>
              <p>Previously, I have used MySQL and Apache for database management systems and data migration. Also I have used Redis with Python projects.</p>
              

              <h4>Devops Architectures</h4>
              <p>We constantly engage with our trainer to ensure we are satisfying the requirements for deployment of all tasks and projects.</p>
