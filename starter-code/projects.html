        <h4>Project 1 - Calino Web App</h4>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/papismurf/ordochao">github.com/papismurf/ordochao</a></p>
        <p>This project is a self built To-Do list web app built in Python/Django, which is still currently in production and the precursor/MVP to a larger IOT idea I have for the future</p>
        <p>Currently it is mostly the back-end structure that has been constructed along with some of the HTML front-end view functionality. I am following a very strict functional and unit testing procedure as it is a large project and is easier to manage with small incremental testing at each stage.</p>

        <p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sneakpeekapp.sneakpeek&hl=en">SneakPeek App</a></p>
        <p>In collaboration with my colleague, we built a video based, product promotion app which you can use to market and sell whatever product you like. Similar to Ebay/Gumtree but better in various ways instead of stiff images, you can present all your products in full flowing, high quality video.</p>

        <h4>Project 3 - ASA Distribution Website</h4>
        <p><a href="http://www.asadistribution.co.uk/">ASA Distribution (Wordpress)</a></p>
        <p>I worked intermittently on this website for ASA as they needed some incremental updates done to their website on the back-end of the content management system such as plugin updates, security improvements etc. As many web developers know a cms like Wordpress can be very insecure due to the variety of plugins which was the main focus on this freelance project requirement.</p>
